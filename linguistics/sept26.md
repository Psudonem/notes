Phonemes and Allophones

Phoneme: Sound that produces a meaning of a word
        - Minimal Pair:
            - Example in english: **B**an and **V**an
Allophone: Variant on the same sound

most languages are tonal

I missed a lot of stuff, reread the text book

Complementray DIstrubution
    - Wether the appearance of one means that the other does not appear

sound contrasts in lang are either
    - phonemic contrasts
    - systematic alternation
    - free alternation
